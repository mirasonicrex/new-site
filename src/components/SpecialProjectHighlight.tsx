          is an indie game that I have been developing solo since October 2022.
          You play from the perspective of a game developer returning to an old
          project that you abandoned, only to find that the game has not stopped
          evolving since you left it. The game is coded in C# using Unity.

        <h3>GOAP System</h3>
        <p>
          I created a custom AI system for the NPCs in my game. The system
          relies on a priority algorithm that weighs eight goals that relate to
          an NPC's needs and chooses the one with the highest priority. Once an
          agent decides on a goal, it uses the GOAP system to plan out the best
          sequence of actions to reach this goal, given the current world state.
          The system works like a pathfinding algorithm, exploring different
          combinations of actions until it finds a viable plan. It chooses the
          most cost-effective plan, meaning the plan that achieves the goal with
          the least amount of steps or resources.

        <p>
          A custom A* pathfinding algorithm designed to work alongside Unityâ€™s
          2D grid system, to add weights to tiles. Used with the custom AI
          system to move NPCs from one place to another while avoiding
          obstacles.

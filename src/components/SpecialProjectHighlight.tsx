          <h2>Indie Game</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://thatisthegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">./ThisIsTheGame</a> is an indie game
            that I have been developing solo since October 2022. You play from the perspective of a game developer returning to an old project that you abandoned, only to find that the game
            has not stopped evolving since you left it. The game is coded in C# using Unity.

          <h4>GOAP System</h4>
          <p>
            I created a custom AI system for the NPCs in my game. The system relies on a priority algorithm that weighs
            eight goals that relate to an NPC's needs and chooses the one with the highest priority. Once an agent
            decides on a goal, it uses the GOAP system to plan out the best sequence of actions to reach this goal,
            given the current world state. The system works like a pathfinding algorithm, exploring different
            combinations of actions until it finds a viable plan. It chooses the most cost-effective plan, meaning the
            plan that achieves the goal with the least amount of steps or resources.

          <h4>A* Pathfinding Algorithm</h4>
          <p>
            A custom A* pathfinding algorithm designed to work alongside Unityâ€™s 2D grid system, to add weights to
            tiles. Used with the custom AI system to move NPCs from one place to another while avoiding obstacles.
